# alu-AirBnB Starter Pack

## Project Desciption & Summary :memo:

This is a clone of the AirBnb website. This project would only be a simple server copy of the real AirBnb website. However, the cloned website would implement the client side (front-end), and the server side (APIs, database, etc.)

This current project can only be implemented on the console or command interpreter. 

## The Command Interpreter :computer:

The console is just like Shell but only limited to specific-use cases - to execute commands on the objects of the projects. The commands include: 

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc… 
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…) 
* Update attributes of an object 
* Destroy an object 
* Exit interpreter

## Starting the Interpreter :rocket:

To start the interpreter, run:

```python
$ ./console.py
```


## Using The Interpreter :repeat:

| Command | Action | Output | 
|---------- |:-------------: |------: | 
| `help` | Displays documented commands | `(hbnb) help` | 
| `help create (any command)` | Create an object of a given class | `(hbnb) help create` |
| `quit` | Ends the command interpreter | `(hbnb) quit` |
| `EOF` | Exit the program | `(hbnb) EOF` |
| `all` | Show all objects of a given class | `(hbnb) all <class>` |
| `show` | Show an object of a given class | `(hbnb) show <class> <id>` |
| `update` | Edit an object of a given class | `(hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> <"attribute value">` |
| `destroy` | Destroy an object of a given class | `(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>` | 

## Tests :artificial_satellite:

To run unittests on the codebases, run: 

```python
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```
